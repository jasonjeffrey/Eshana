## Backstory
In the harsh steppes of the [[Kratoa]] wilderness, warlords vie in a constant battle for survival and dominance. Among the most brutal and successful is the great orc chieftain [[Gog]], the self-styled king of the steppes. 

The only thing that has brought Gog more pride than his own martial prowess is the many children he has sired across the numerous tribes he has subjugated into his vast empire. One such child was Magog, who's mother was [[Kesreg]], a wise druid well-respected among her own tribe. 

Other than a strong physical resemblance, as Magog grew it became apparent he has nothing in common with his father. He lacked the vicious nature and raw strength that was prized most among the Kratoan steppes, and which all his half-siblings seemed to have inherited in abundance from their formidable father. Considered weak of heart and limb, the small child became something of a pariah among the tribes' other young, loved only by his mother (who's own good standing was his only shield against the full harshness of Kratoan society) and largely ignored or scorned by his elders, his disappointed father chief among them. 

One day, Gog learnt a prophecy. It foretold that one of his own children would succeed him as king or queen of the steppes, and that his successor's weakness would bring his legacy and his empire to ruin. Obsessed with breaking this prophecy, Gog began pitting his children against each other, forcing them to compete in endless challenges designed ensure only the strongest would survive long enough to succeed him. These challenges favoured the values Gog himself valued the most, martial skill, inhuman fortitude and iron-hearted resolve. That way, the weak would be weeded out and disposed of, and the survivors would be worthy successors to Gog's throne. 

The child Magog, the youngest and weakest of the competitors, still little chance of surviving against his cruel elder half-siblings. Knowing this, Kesreg made a fateful decision to flee into the wilderness, consigning herself and her son to a hermetic life in wandering the wilds - alone but safe from Gog and his children.

Magog spent the rest of his childhood living a nomadic life. Kesreg's druidic magic and knowledge of the wild keeping them alive. Remarkable, once away from the harsh law of the tribes, Magog came into his own. He inherited his mother's affinity for nature and love of the wild places, and as he grew to be a talented hunter and ranger. 

Eventually they settled in a large forest, far from civilised society. Despite their isolation, they were far from alone. Magog spent much of formative years travelling between the small communities who called the woodland their home. particularly gnomes and wood elves, trading their skills as Hunters and healers.

Eventually they settled in a vast forested land, far from civilised society. Despite their isolation, they were far from alone. Magog spent much of formative years travelling between the small communities who called the woodland their home, forming unlikely bonds with wood elves, gnomes and various other forest folk with whom they traded and worked with. It was the only time that Magog felt truly at peace.

Despite all, Kesreg never allowed them to drop their guard. They could never be sure just how far Gog would go to protect his legacy. They shared their true names with only a trusted few, and the details of their past life with no one. Though they often worked as guides for travellers and adventurers, Kesreg was always wary of those who seemed particularly well-travelled or renowned, for fear they might end up passing details of their existence may find its way back to Kratoa. She ensured they steered clear of any activity that might draw attention to themselves, particularly conflict or contact with larger communities.

It was not enough to escape their past. On that fateful day, Magog was hunting alone when he realised too late that he himself was being tracked. The bounty hunter was the first real fighter the young orc had ever faced, and he was overpowered and captured with pitiful ease. Only Kesreg's sudden arrival distracted the bounty hunter long enough for Magog to slip his bonds and sink a blade in the warrior's back, the first sentient life he had taken. But Kesreg had paid the ultimate price for her intervention, having been left mortally wounded in the fight, beyond Magog's limited healing skills to save. Her final words imploring Magog to flee deeper into the forest, to hide and survive at all costs.

For while he obeyed his mother's final command, but Magog began to find that a peaceful life of solitude no longer held the same appeal to him. He could no longer turn his back on the injustices he percieved around, to meekly ignore those that entered the forest to destroy the lives of those that sought to only to live. Poachers stalking fey creatures found themselves turned prey. Loggers exploiting sacred groves found their camps and caravans raided by a lone archer.

But it was not enough. Magog knew he needed vengeance, against the bounty hunter's guild, against his family.
