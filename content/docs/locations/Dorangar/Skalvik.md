# Skalvik

humble fishing village in the most north western part of Eshana. It is tucked deep within a wide, majestic fjord. Towering snow-covered mountains of Thrymfell rise high into the sky to the north, their jagged peaks often shrouded in mist and veiled by drifting snow all year round. The village itself clings to the rocky shoreline, where the frigid sea laps against dilapidated docks and weathered boats bob gently in the current.

The dense pine forest of Eldskogr wraps round the east of the village towards the coast in the south. The forest appears to stretch on endlessly. 

The village is built almost entirely of single-floor longhouses—sturdy timber structures with thick thatched roofs and intricately carved beams. Smoke rises steadily from the central hearths, curling into the frigid air, carrying the scent of woodsmoke, salt, and fish. Nets dry on wooden frames near the shore, and the village's few stone-paved paths are well-trodden, connecting the longhouses, the smokehouse, and the modest mead hall that serves as the village’s heart.

Life in Skalvik is quiet, hard, and bound by tradition. The people here are resilient and deeply tied to the rhythms of the sea and snow, living with reverence for the land, the water, and the old tales whispered by firelight when the Westerly winds howl through the fjord.
