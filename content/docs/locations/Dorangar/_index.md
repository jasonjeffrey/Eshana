# Dorangar

Eshana's rugged north-western region—a wild land shaped by stone, root, and snow. Towering pine forests cloak the foothills of jagged mountain ranges. The air smells of pine resin, smoke, and salt, and the land itself seems alive with old magic. It is a place of stone fortresses, sacred groves, and mead-soaked feasts beneath the northern lights.
 
The lands inhabited by mountain dwarfs, wood elves and Norse-like humans — wolf-cloaked warriors.
