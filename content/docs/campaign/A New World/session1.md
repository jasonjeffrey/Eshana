[Ek'ho the Moon Thief]({{< ref "/docs/players/ekho" >}}) in his search to find more on how he can fulfil his ambition to return to the sky and find more about the gods. Found himself entering the small north western village of [Skalvik]({{< ref "/docs/locations/Dorangar/skalvik" >}}). 

it is mid morning on the first day of the third week of the time of Ã†ostara (3rd Week of Spring). Upon entering the village he witnesses a small funeral party heading up from the dockside. they stop to lay alpine flowers at the foot of what appears to be an ice sculpture of a male dwarf. a few are sobbing but the party continue and enter the large 2 story longhouse at the head of main street within the village.

Ek'ho follows the party into longhouse which turns out to be the village's Mead House. Inside the Mead house, he sees two warriors at the bar drinking and chatting who he later discovers to be [Bragat Kickback]({{< ref "/docs/players/bragat" >}}) and [Tristan the Brave]({{< ref "/docs/players/tristan" >}}). Off to his left, he sees the funeral party and on the stage [Nymphadora Nightingale]({{< ref "/docs/players/nymphadora" >}}) playing the lute and singing about the story of the lost pearl. Finally to the right, in a dark corner is a hooded figure sitting alone.

Fascinated by the subject of the lost pearl watches Nymphadora intently. At the End of her set she heads to the bar. After a discussion at the bar between the four members on their shared interest in the gods and mythology. They enquire a little more about the wake happening off to one side of the bar. The bartender explains that the ice sculpture in the middle of the town is actually [Skarn Ironmourn]({{< ref "/docs/npcs/dorangar/skarnironmourn" >}}) an explorer who had recently returned from the [Draugfrost]({{< ref "/docs/locations/Dorangar/draugfrost" >}}). After his return he froze to death where he stands.  The bartender also explains that the hooded dwarf is only known to him as [[The Recruiter]]. He visits the village now and then and trys to recruit strong and able bodied creatures.

Intrigued by both the wake and the hooded figure the group of 4 split to discuss with both.

Those who approached the wake were meet by a the Village Chieftan. He explained that the village is currently terrified of the unknown illness that caused the demise of Skarn and worry more will be next. He asks the party if they will look into what happened and if they can help to prevent the illness in anyway.

The party who spoke with The Recruiter. he did not reveal much only he was looking for able bodies to help with a simple task. to drive an oxen led cart to his friends in the town in [[Eidvarn]]. The party would be paid 40gp on the safe delivery of the cart but were strictly asked not to look within its crates. With some bribery of Ale the recruiter let slip, a logo that was stitched within his jacket. A Silvery Egg shape, held upon a golden hand.

The Party regrouped and after a discussion and there shared interest in the gods. They decided to accept the recruiters offer and collected the cart and set off for Eidvarn along the [Great Western Road]({{< ref "/docs/locations/Dorangar/greatwesternroad" >}}).

during the 3 and a half day trek, Nymph spent time studying a collection of history articles she had collected and found reference to a ancient magical disease called the [[Frigid Woe]] created by the advanced organisation of spellcasters who were is search of the gateway to [[Ulthevir]] in the Draugfrost. The group have long since disappeared and they held the only known cure. 

The party speak with a passing trader who was heading in the direction of Skalvik to relay what has been learnt the message back to the village chieftain.

On the last day, the party turn off the Great Western road and head east towards Eidvarn. Along the road the party found the path blocked by two dead horses. the brave Tristan and the bard approach the horses, only to be ambushed by some goblins. A skirmish ensues leaving both Tristan and Nymph unconscious while the warrior Bragat bravely watched on from the driving seat of the cart. 

Ek'ho after the skirmish noticed a patch leading into the woods. He slowly follows the path on his own leaving Braget to load both the unconscious party members on top the wagon. Ek'ho with care dodged traps along the way till he arrived at a clearing which lead to a cave opening and a gentle stream exiting the cave mouth. Ek'ho decided to regroup with the party before entering the cave. 

After returning back to the road, Bragat and Ek'ho ride the cart into the Eidvarn. The whole party had regained consciousness by the time they reached the town. They took the cart to the warehouse the recruiter had asked. On Arrival they are meet by a nondescript human, who checks the cart and dispels some kind of magic over the cargo. Satisfied he pays the party the 40gp and rides the cart into the warehouse. 

The party after spending some time wandering the town, settle down for a long rest in a local stables to wake up in the early hours with a plan to break into the warehouse where the cart was left. 

The party rises in the middle of the night and head for the warehouse. After failing many attempts to break in, including trying to throw the paladin onto the roof. The party return back to the stables. 

Waking Mid morning the party gathers and head back to the cave which Ek'ho discovered earlier.

As the party, tried to enter the cave they were ambushed by more goblins. the party quickly dispatched the goblins and entered the cave.  Ek'ho found a small chimey to climb and left the rest of the party to head around by the river. The session ended with the party in combat with a group of 5 goblins and Ek'ho in an adjacent room hiding behind a column. obsering a bug bear and more goblins.
